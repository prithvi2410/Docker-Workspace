-----------------------------Docker-----------------------------

1. Docker File
	-> converts our appliation to a 'Image'
	
2. Image	
	-> a lightweight, standalone, and executable package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software, including the code, runtime, libraries, environment variables, and configuration files
	-> image can be started using a container
	-> Docker images act as a set of instructions to build a Docker cotainer.
	-> immutable and portable
	
3. Container
	-> an isolated environment where an application runs 
	-> lightweight, portable, and self-contained - they include everything needed to run the application, including the code, runtime, system tools, and libraries
